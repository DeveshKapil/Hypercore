## Project Status Summary

### How much of the project is done?
- Core architecture and scaffolding are largely complete.
- The project boots, initializes hardware, and sets up the main kernel loop.
- Modular code structure is in place for graphics, process management, memory, interrupts, networking, and storage.
- Traits and interfaces for device drivers (Ethernet, WiFi, Bluetooth) are defined and integrated.
- PCI/USB/UART detection logic and device abstraction layers are implemented.
- Ceph integration and basic file management traits are present.

### What’s behind schedule?
- Real hardware driver implementation.
- Actual, production-grade drivers for Intel Ethernet, WiFi, and Bluetooth are not yet complete.
- Real-world device communication (MMIO, DMA, interrupts, protocol stacks) is still at the stub/mock stage.
- Advanced features and robustness.
- Full paging, swapping, and advanced memory protection are not yet implemented.
- Security features (privilege separation, secure boot, VM isolation) are not yet realized.
- No full networking stack (TCP/IP, DHCP, ARP) or userland/guest OS support.
- Testing on real hardware.
- Most modules have not been validated on actual Intel 7th Gen+ systems or in production-like environments.

### What’s ahead of schedule?
- Modular and extensible design.
- The codebase is already highly modular, making future driver and feature integration easier.
- Device abstraction and trait-based design are more advanced than in many early-stage OS projects.
- Documentation and planning.
- The project has thorough documentation, a clear roadmap, and well-defined interfaces for all major subsystems.
- Ceph and distributed storage integration.
- Early integration of distributed storage (Ceph) is more advanced than typical for a first hypervisor pass.
