# Hypervisor Project Progress

---

## ✅ **Tasks Successfully Implemented**

1. **Graphics Modernization**
   - Removed legacy VGA support.
   - Implemented a framebuffer-based graphics module suitable for HDMI/DPI.

2. **Process Scheduling**
   - Implemented a multi-level feedback queue scheduler with round-robin and HRRN.
   - Added process management and state tracking.

3. **Memory Management**
   - Implemented a simple frame allocator.
   - Added paging and a page fault handler stub.
   - Provided LRU cache logic for memory management.

4. **Interrupt Handling**
   - Set up an IDT with handlers for breakpoints, page faults, and double faults.
   - Integrated page fault handler with memory paging logic.

5. **Networking (Stub/Logic)**
   - Defined a trait and struct for network configuration.
   - Implemented logic for Ethernet, WiFi, and Bluetooth configuration (prints and checks).

6. **Ceph Integration (Stub/Logic)**
   - Defined a trait for Ceph file management.
   - Implemented a real Ceph manager using the `ceph-rust` crate for file operations.

7. **Bootloader Integration**
   - Added instructions and Makefile targets for building a bootable image using the `bootloader` crate.
   - Provided guidance for running the kernel in QEMU.

8. **General Codebase Improvements**
   - Fixed linter errors and improved code safety.
   - Modularized code for memory, process, network, and Ceph management.

## ❗ **Tasks Left for Real-Life Implementation**

1. **Real Hardware/Device Integration**
   - Implement actual drivers for Ethernet, WiFi, and Bluetooth (not just print logic).
   - Integrate with real hardware or virtual devices (PCI, USB, etc.).

2. **Ceph Integration in a Real Kernel/Hypervisor**
   - Ensure `ceph-rust` or FFI bindings work in your target environment (not all environments support this).
   - Handle authentication, error recovery, and performance tuning for Ceph.

3. **Full Paging and Virtual Memory**
   - Implement real page allocation, mapping, and swapping.
   - Support for page table management, TLB invalidation, and protection bits.

4. **Advanced Process/Thread Management**
   - Implement context switching, user/kernel mode separation, and process isolation.
   - Add support for threads, signals, and IPC.

5. **Device and Peripheral Support**
   - Add drivers for storage (NVMe, SATA), input (keyboard, mouse), and display (framebuffer, GPU).
   - Support for USB, PCI, and other buses.

6. **Security and Isolation**
   - Implement privilege levels, memory protection, and secure boot.
   - Add VM isolation if supporting virtualization.

7. **Performance and Robustness**
   - Optimize memory and process management for real workloads.
   - Add logging, debugging, and monitoring tools.

8. **Testing and Deployment**
   - Test on real hardware and/or in virtualized environments.
   - Create deployment scripts and documentation.

9. **Userland/Guest OS Support (if hypervisor)**
   - Implement VM creation, management, and guest OS booting.
   - Provide virtual devices to guests.

10. **Error Handling and Recovery**
    - Robust error handling for all subsystems.
    - Graceful recovery from faults and panics.
